# Project 2 - Clustering and Drug Discovery
## Due 02/17/2021

![BuildStatus](https://github.com/jackieroger/Project2/workflows/HW2/badge.svg?event=push)

This API evaluates results from a high-throughput virtual screen against the SARS-CoV2 Spike/ Human ACE2 interface. To determine any defining differences or similarities in the dataset, two different clustering algorithms are implemented: partition clustering and hierarchical clustering.

Documentation (via Sphinx) can be found at docs/_build/html/index.html.

My answers for part 2 are in Jackie_Roger_BMI203_HW2.ipynb. Screenshots from the pymol adventure are located in part2_plots/question_10/.

To run unit tests, run the following command from the project root directory:
```
python -m pytest test/*
```
